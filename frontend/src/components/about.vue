    <h2>About Shuttle Tracker</h2>
    <p>
      Shuttle Tracker is
      <a href="https://github.com/thepoly/shuttletracker">open source</a> and is maintained by members of
      <i><a href="https://poly.rpi.edu">The Polytechnic</a></i> for the benefit of the student body.
      The <a href="https://webtech.union.rpi.edu">Web Technologies Group</a> of the Rensselaer Union Student Senate created the project.
      It is also an active
      <a href="https://rcos.io">RCOS</a> project, and dozens of students have contributed to it through RCOS in previous semesters.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is there no app?</h3>
    <p>We're focused on making the Shuttle Tracker website as good as it can be. While most of our users are on mobile, we think the best way to deliver a great experience to the most people is to focus our efforts on this website.</p>
    <h3>How can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>
      We have an active
      <a href="https://github.com/thepoly/shuttletracker">repository</a> on GitHub where we track issues and accept pull requests. If you want to get involved in another way, email
      <a href="mailto:tech@poly.rpi.edu">tech@poly.rpi.edu</a> for more information.
